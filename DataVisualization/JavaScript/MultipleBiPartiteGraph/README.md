# Project Pigeo
Project Pigeo is a humanitarian project by Techno Rex, from University of Dhaka, with a goal to minimize social insecurity specially for women. The project aims to develop a low-cost technology based solution to minimize social issues i.e. rape, public harassment, hijacking etc.  Hence, for user research, we conducted our extensive survey among 242 people inside & outside Dhaka.
